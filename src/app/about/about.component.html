  Coastfields is an ex-haven site which opens from March 1 until the end of October. 
  This site has an indoor heated swimming pool with flumes, childrens paddling area and Jacuzzi, 
  a 500 seat club house with live entertainment throughout the season, including onsite childrens 
  entertainers. Luckie the lion and other characters can be seen wandering around the site 
  throughout the day and on stage in the evening. There is also an amusement arcade, a Londis 
  supermarket, Chinese takeaway/Chip shop, separate fish and chip shop, Ba Rumba night club, 
  Pizza/burger kiosk plus more. There is also an outdoor childrens play area in the centre of 
  the site. The beach is exactly opposite the front of the site. Again, Fantasy Island and 
  Eastgate Market are within easy walking distance from this site. Coastfields provide a small 
  free train going backwards and forwards from the front of the site to Sea Lane throughout the 
  main part of the season.We have a total of 14 caravans available for rent on Coastfields. 
  We also have the pizza/burger kiosk attached to Ba Rumba on the front off the site. We provide 
  all our guests with a 10% discount card to use at this facility during their stay. We have a 
  number of outside seats for warmer weather. When cold, food can be eaten in the attached pub 
  or taken back to your caravans.

  Duvets, pillows are provided in all vans but you do need to provide your own bed linen and 
  towels although these can be hired for a small fee. Most of our caravans have either a 
  balcony or a closed in verandah on the lounge doors. Luxury caravans include Travel cots, 
  highchairs, irons, plus more. These items can also be hired at a very minimal cost to go 
  into any other van.  All bedding is included in luxury caravans as standard.
